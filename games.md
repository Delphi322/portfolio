# Games

The first game I made was **Monsters and Mayhem** 
This was a top down game where you ran around the different areas fighting monsters. There wasn't much to it but I did give every enemy different stats

The second game I made was when I took part in a game jam with a few other students and we named it **The Alpaca and the Mansion**
This was a puzzle platformer game where the Alpaca you played as could switch between it's normal and ghost form. Each form had different strengths and weaknesses and puzzles had you use both forms.

The third game I made was **Demon Slayer**
This was a 2d side scroller platformer designed to be challenging and punishing if the player didn't heed caution.
